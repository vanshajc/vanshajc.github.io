<h3>
Welcome to my web page!
</h3>

<p>
I graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute this May 2018 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Robotics Engineering. Over the course of my 4 years at WPI, I have gotten the opportunity to work on a large number of projects, which can be found <a href="projects.html"> here</a>. My passion lies in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Automating systems and understanding how to solve difficult and dangerous problems has been a huge interest of mine. I hope to be able to continuously challenge myself to create innovative solutions to real-world problems in a fast-paced environment. I am currently looking for full-time opportunities involving software engineering.
